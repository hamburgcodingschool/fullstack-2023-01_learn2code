# Lesson 6 - Verschiedene Dinge

## if / else if / else

Sometimes you need more than the two options of a simple if / else. For that we can couple more than one if together in this way:

```JavaScript
if (condition1) {

} else if (condition2) {

} else if (condition3) {

} else {

}
```

As we've seen in the fizzbuzz example, it's important if the conditions overlap, that you keep in mind the order of the conditions.
